BitSpout
========
This is an old project of mine from 2015.
While it no longer lives up to my standards, I'm leaving it up for historical reasons.
As far as I remember, the actual fountain coding bit of this works.
(But the networking part does not.)
The spirtual successor to this is the fountain_codes Rust crate on my Github.
